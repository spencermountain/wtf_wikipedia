A '''Runtime Callable Wrapper''' (RCW) is a [[proxy pattern|proxy]] object generated by the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) in order to allow a [[Component Object Model]] (COM) object to be accessed from managed code. Although the RCW appears to be an ordinary object to .NET clients, its primary function is to [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshal]] calls and data between a .NET client and a COM object.

For example, a managed application written in C# might make use of an existing COM library written in C++ or Visual Basic 6, via RCWs.

The runtime creates exactly one RCW for each COM object, regardless of the number of references that exist on that object. The runtime maintains a single RCW per process for each object. If you create an RCW in one application domain or apartment, and then pass a reference to another application domain or apartment, a proxy to the first object will be used.
