Although the [[Restoration (1660)|monarchy was restored]], the [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]] ensured (along with the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and the subsequent [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]]) that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne.

[[File:Treaty of Union.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Treaty of Union]] led to a single united kingdom encompassing all Great Britain]]

In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under [[Robert Walpole]], in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of [[Jacobite Uprisings]] sought to remove the Protestant [[House of Hanover]] from the British throne and restore the Catholic [[House of Stuart]]. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, after which the [[Scottish Highlanders]] were brutally suppressed. The British colonies in North America that broke away from Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] became the United States of America, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned elsewhere, particularly to [[Company rule in India|India]].<ref>Library of Congress, [https://books.google.com/?id=BQDgr_XvsHoC&pg=PA73 ''The Impact of the American Revolution Abroad''], p. 73.</ref>

During the 18th century, Britain was involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. British [[Slave ship|ships]] transported an estimated two million slaves from Africa to the West Indies before banning the trade in 1807, banning slavery in 1833, and taking a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide by pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties, and then formed the world's oldest international human rights organisation, [[Anti-Slavery International]], in London in 1839.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513171717/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION=201.html "Anti-Slavery International"].

===Union with Ireland===
{{main|Acts of Union 1800}}
The term "United Kingdom" became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Britain and Ireland each passed an [[Acts of Union (1800)|Act of Union]], uniting the two kingdoms and creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act |title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=15 May 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|alt=Painting of a bloody battle. Horses and infantry fight or lie on grass.|The [[Battle of Waterloo]], 1815, marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the start of ''[[Pax Britannica]]'']]
In the early 19th century, the British-led [[Industrial Revolution]] began to transform the country. Gradually political power shifted away from the old [[Tory]] and [[Whiggism|Whig]] landowning classes towards the new industrialists. An alliance of merchants and industrialists with the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] would lead to a new party, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], with an ideology of [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''. In 1832 Parliament passed the [[Great Reform Act]], which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes. In the countryside, [[enclosure]] of the land was driving small farmers out. Towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class. Few ordinary workers had the vote, and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After the defeat of France at the end of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792–1815), Great Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).<ref>Tellier, L.-N.

Social reform and home rule for Ireland were important domestic issues after 1900.

This led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s, with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.<ref>Rubinstein, W. D. (2004). ''Capitalism, Culture, and Decline in Britain, 1750–1990''. Abingdon: Routledge. p. 11. {{ISBN|0-415-03719-0}}.</ref>

Britain entered the [[Second World War]] by declaring war on [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, after Germany had invaded Poland. [[Winston Churchill]] became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war, Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany. In 1940, the [[Royal Air Force]] defeated the German [[Luftwaffe]] in a struggle for control of the skies in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during [[the Blitz]]. There were also eventual hard-fought victories in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], the [[North Africa campaign]] and the [[Burma campaign]]. British forces played an important role in the [[Normandy landings]] of 1944, achieved with its United States ally.

In the decade-long process of [[European integration]], the UK was a founding member of the alliance called the [[Western European Union]], established with the [[London and Paris Conferences]] in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the [[European Communities]] (EC). When the EC became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding members. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, which forms the constitutional basis of the European Union since then.

From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as [[the Troubles]].

Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Conservative government of the 1980s]] under [[Margaret Thatcher]] initiated a radical policy of [[monetarism]], deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies ([[privatisation]]), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.<ref>{{cite book |title=British politics since 1945 |first=Peter |last=Dorey |year=1995 |pages=164–223 |isbn=978-0-631-19075-2 |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell |series=Making contemporary Britain}}</ref> This resulted in high unemployment and social unrest, but ultimately also economic growth, particularly in the services sector.

{{Main article|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round.<ref name="factbook"/> The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below {{convert|-11|C|lk=on}} or rising above {{convert|35|C}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ |title=UK climate summaries |publisher=Met Office |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67yAsDB9c?url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,<ref name="factbook"/> although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest.

England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK's government and parliament on all issues.

The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Assembly]] have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a [[diarchy]] representing [[Designated Unionist|unionist]] and [[Designated Nationalist|nationalist]] members of the Assembly: the most recent pairing was [[Arlene Foster]] (Democratic Unionist Party) and [[Martin McGuinness]] (Sinn Féin) who were [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] respectively until 2017.<ref name="northernireland1">{{cite web |url=https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/topics/your-executive |title=Your Executive |publisher=Northern Ireland Executive}}</ref> Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the [[North-South Ministerial Council]], where the Northern Ireland Executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the [[Government of Ireland]].

The British armed forces played a key role in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|dominant world power]] in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Throughout its unique history the British forces have seen action in a number of major wars, such as the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Crimean War]], the [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]—as well as many colonial conflicts. By emerging victorious from such conflicts, Britain has often been able to decisively [[Congress of Vienna|influence world events]]. Since the end of the British Empire, the UK has nonetheless remained a major military power. Following the end of the [[Cold War]], defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.<ref>''UK 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''. Office for National Statistics. p. 89.</ref> Setting aside the [[Operation Palliser|intervention in Sierra Leone]], recent UK military operations in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[Role of the United Kingdom in the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], [[Operation Telic|Iraq]] and, most recently, [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya]], have followed this approach. The last occasion on which the British military fought alone was the [[Falklands War]] of 1982.

According to various sources, including the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] and the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], the United Kingdom has the fourth- or fifth-highest [[List of countries by military expenditures|military expenditure]] in the world.

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main article|Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom}}
Access to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is
estimated that 96.7% of households are connected to the sewer network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wssinfo.org/download?id_document=988 |title=WHO / UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme: 404 error |publisher=}}</ref> According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 [[megalitre]]s per day in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/data/112185.aspx |title=Environment Agency |publisher=}}</ref> In England and Wales the economic regulator of water companies is the [[Water Services Regulation Authority]] (Ofwat). The [[Environment Agency]] is responsible for environmental regulation, and the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] for regulating drinking water quality. The economic water industry regulator in [[Scotland]] is the Water Industry Commission for Scotland and the environmental regulator is the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]]. Drinking water standards and wastewater discharge standards in the UK, as in other countries of the [[European Union]], are determined by the EU (see [[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union]]).

In England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water
and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private "water only"
companies. In Scotland water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, [[Scottish Water]]. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, [[Northern Ireland Water]].

'''Northern Ireland'''
{{Main article|Education in Northern Ireland}}
[[Education in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Education]], although responsibility at a local level is administered by the [[Education Authority]] which is further sub-divided into five geographical areas. The [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment]] (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the [[Northern Ireland Executive|government]] on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications.<ref>{{cite web |author=CCEA |url=http://www.ccea.org.uk/ |title=About Us&nbsp;– What we do |publisher=Council for the Curriculum Examinations & Assessment |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref>

Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved matter]] and each country has its own system of private and [[publicly funded health care]], together with [[alternative medicine|alternative]], holistic and complementary treatments. Public healthcare is provided to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The [[World Health Organization]], in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.<ref name="Who2000">{{Cite book |editor-last=Haden |editor-first=Angela |editor2-last=Campanini |editor2-first=Barbara |title=The world health report 2000&nbsp;– Health systems: improving performance |year=2000 |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organisation |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |isbn=92-4-156198-X |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Statistics/WHO-COMP-Study-30.pdf |title=Measuring overall health system performance for 191 countries |author=[[World Health Organization]] |publisher=New York University |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.healthp.org/node/71 |title=The NHS from Thatcher to Blair |first=Peter |last=Fisher |work=NHS Consultants Association |publisher=International Association of Health Policy |quote=The Budget&nbsp;... was even more generous to the NHS than had been expected amounting to an annual rise of 7.4% above the rate of inflation for the next 5 years.

Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based, such as the [[Royal College]]s. However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national [[executive (government)|executives]]; [[healthcare in England]] is the responsibility of the UK Government; [[healthcare in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]; [[healthcare in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Scottish Government]]; and [[healthcare in Wales]] is the responsibility of the [[Welsh Government]].

==Culture==
{{Main article|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its [[History of the United Kingdom|history]] as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a [[political union]] of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the [[British Empire]], British influence can be observed in the [[English language|language]], [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]] and [[Common law|legal systems]] of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and the United States. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower".<ref name="culture">[http://www.britishpoliticssociety.no/British%20Politics%20Review%2001_2011.pdf "The cultural superpower: British cultural projection abroad"].

Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school [[University of the Arts London]], which includes the [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] and [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]]; [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]; the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] (part of [[University College London]]); the [[Glasgow School of Art]]; the [[Royal College of Art]]; and [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] (part of the University of Oxford). The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] is a leading centre for the teaching of the [[history of art]]. Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the [[National Gallery]], [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]], [[Tate Britain]] and [[Tate Modern]] (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7&nbsp;million visitors per year).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article7105032.ece |title=The startling success of Tate Modern |accessdate=19 January 2011 |newspaper=The Times |date=24 April 2010 |location=London |first=Stephen |last=Bayley}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of American and European influence. British producers are active in [[international co-productions]] and British actors, directors and crew feature regularly in American films. Many successful Hollywood films have been based on British people, [[British literature|stories]] or events, including ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]''.

Major sports, including association football, [[tennis]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[golf]], [[boxing]], [[netball]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[cricket]], originated or were substantially developed in the UK and the states that preceded it. With the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th century [[Victorian Britain]], in 2012, the President of the IOC, [[Jacques Rogge]], stated; "This great, sports-loving country is widely recognized as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum".<ref>[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Games_London_2012/London_2012_Opening_ceremony_Speech_Jacques_Rogge.pdf "Opening ceremony of the games of the XXX Olympiad"].

In most international competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing all of Ireland, with notable exceptions being association football and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. In sporting contexts, the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish / Northern Irish teams are often referred to collectively as the [[Home Nations]]. There are some sports in which a single team represents the whole of United Kingdom, including the Olympics, where the UK is represented by the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain team]]. The [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] Summer Olympics were held in London, making it the first city to host the games three times. Britain has participated in every modern Olympic Games to date and is third in the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|medal count]].

The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] (also referred to as the Union Jack). It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the [[Flag of England]] on the [[Flag of Scotland]] and updated in 1801 with the addition of [[Saint Patrick's Flag]]. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7114248.stm |title=Welsh dragon call for Union flag |publisher=BBC News |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}</ref> The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is "[[God Save the Queen]]", with "Queen" replaced with "King" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a man.

[[Britannia]] is a [[national personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from [[Roman Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=25 June 2006}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding on the back of a lion. Since the height of the British Empire in the late 19th century, Britannia has often been associated with British maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song "[[Rule, Britannia!]]". Up until 2008, the lion symbol was depicted behind Britannia on the [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|British fifty pence coin]] and on the back of the [[Ten pence (British decimal coin)|British ten pence coin]]. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the British Army.

A second, less used, personification of the nation is the character [[John Bull]]. The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Steve |title=Picturing the Beast |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2001 |page=52 |isbn=0-252-07030-5}}</ref>
