It allowed developers to create interfaces that can directly interact with [[Open Database Connectivity]] (ODBC) data sources on remote machines, without having to deal with the comparatively complex ODBC API.

Remote Data Objects was included with versions 4, 5, and 6 of Visual Basic; the final version of RDO is version 2.0.
