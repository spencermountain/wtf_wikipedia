'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] often defined as [[self-governance|self-governed]] voluntary institutions,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.&quot; George Woodcock. &quot;Anarchism&quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. &quot;Anarchism&quot; from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 &quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean.

There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a &quot;classless&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot; society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.&quot; [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the memergence and dissolution of Hierarchy. CHESHIRE BOOKS
Palo Alto. 1982. Pg. 3''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the &quot;sociology of power&quot;) and the correlative duty to obey (as explored in the &quot;philosophy of practical reason&quot;). Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &quot;authoritative&quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&quot; [[Emma Goldman]]. &quot;What it Really Stands for Anarchy&quot; in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism&amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

These chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that can be found in the Laozi with the practices that lead to the cultivation and nurturing of life. &quot; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/zhuangzi/ &quot;Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tzu, 369–298 BCE)&quot; at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Zhuangzi wrote, &quot;A petty thief is put in jail.

The French [[Renaissance humanism|renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] wrote in his most famous work the ''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie's treatise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se. But while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=6o-8P3iqf7IC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=anarchism+la+boetie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z79GU1rW1t&amp;sig=4ini7oZUie2U8-P0BpMLogXYWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eAOFUJCYJ4Le9AT_iYG4DA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anarchism%20la%20boetie&amp;f=false ''Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' by Murray Rothbard. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quite rightly, La Boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader, elected by the people, becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny. Indeed, we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission.&quot;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/saul-newman-voluntary-servitude-reconsidered-radical-politics-and-the-problem-of-self-dominatio &quot;Voluntary Servitude Reconsidered: Radical Politics and the Problem of Self-Domination&quot;] [[Saul Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The radical [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant Christian]] [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and his group the [[Diggers]] are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the Diggers, or True Levellers, in seventeenth-century England led by Gerrard Winstanley as a source of pride. Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html Kenneth C. Wenzer. &quot;Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition — a Bicentennial Tribute&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the [[Levellers]] and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''.&quot; Marlow. &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609 – c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods.&quot; George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006.

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;&gt;Everhart, Robert B.

Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence&amp;nbsp;...&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793)&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first ''self-proclaimed'' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, ''[[What is Property?]],'' published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, &quot;Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.&quot; In ''What is Property?'' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this with what he called &quot;possession,&quot; or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that &quot;Property is Liberty,&quot; and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart. Introduction to ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. 1969, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

''Anarchism: a history of libertarian movements''. Pg. 357&lt;/ref&gt; and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to [[George Woodcock]] &quot;These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock.

One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included {{quote|[[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised&amp;nbsp;... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;implementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848&amp;nbsp;... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html &quot;The Paris Commune&quot; by Anarcho]&lt;/ref&gt;}} George Woodcock states:
{{quote|a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organisation of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the [[Collectivist anarchism|libertarian collectivists]] Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and [[Elisée Reclus]] and Louise Michel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;}}

The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made.

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58&amp;nbsp;million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]&amp;nbsp;... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed|Illegalism|Expropriative anarchism}}
[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Italian-American]] anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on 'tyrants' and 'enemies of the people']]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, 25 July 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=21 April 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s, and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '[[Confiscation|expropriations]]'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20090312022528 |url=http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm |title=&quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be ''exemplary'' invitations to revolt.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm The &quot;illegalists&quot; by Doug Imrie. From &quot;Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed&quot;, Fall–Winter, 1994–95]&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labour movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favoured individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July–August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]]'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].

===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt uprising]], before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&quot; Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-486-43270-X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organisations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutions of 1917–23|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] which established the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Munich Soviet (or &quot;Council Republic&quot;) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though — like most revolutions — its stated goals were not exactly &quot;temporary.&quot; Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B. Traven), gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor.&quot; [[Hakim Bey]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Fabbri]], was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress&quot;/&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''.

On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] at [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]] when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot; Shepherd&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mühsam|first=Erich|editor=David A.

In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like [[Catalonia]], the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivization]] enactment.

[[File:Paul Goodman.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], influential American anarchist author of ''[[Growing Up Absurd|Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society]]'' among other works critical of contemporary societies.]] Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between [[synthesis anarchism]] and [[platformism]] took importance once again especially in the [[Anarchism in Italy#Postwar years and today|anarchist movements of Italy]] and [[Anarchism in France#The Fourth Republic (1945–1958)|France]].

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Frank_Fernandez__Cuban_Anarchism__The_History_of_A_Movement.html#toc8 ''Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement'' by Frank Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertgraham.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/ Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977) « Robert Graham's Anarchism Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 in [[Anarchism in France|France]] the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] and the anarchosyndicalist trade union [[Confédération nationale du travail]] was established in the next year while the also [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist]] [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] was founded in [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.&quot;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence.

By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.&quot; [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the [[Fédération anarchiste|Fédération Anarchiste]]), the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] of Italy and the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], ecological and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; According to anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]&amp;nbsp;... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]].

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail – Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]]  and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]] and [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]].

[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical anarchist schools of thought===

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform.

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;/&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;/&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

[[William B.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

====Social anarchism====
{{Main|Social anarchism}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens&amp;nbsp;... the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?] ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;&quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use.

This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or ''[[propaganda by the deed]]'', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=978-1-904859-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-36182-6 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Anarcho-syndicalism=====
{{Main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|May day demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], Basque Country in 2010]]Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[trade union|labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labour unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]]
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]] – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labour movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary [[Coercion|coercive]] hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International]], and [[postcolonialism]].

[[Left-wing market anarchism]] strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Writing before the rise of the Carson–Long school of left-libertarianism, historian of American anarchism David DeLeon was disinclined to treat any market-oriented variant of libertarianism as leftist; see DeLeon, David (1978).

And markets, properly understood, have always been about cooperation. As a commenter at Reason magazine’s Hit&amp;Run blog, remarking on Jesse Walker’s link to the Kelly article, put it:  “every trade is a cooperative act.” In fact, it’s a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label “socialism.”&quot;.[http://c4ss.org/content/670 &quot;Socialism: A Perfectly Good Word Rehabilitated&quot;] by [[Kevin Carson]] at website of Center for a Stateless Society&lt;/ref&gt;

However Rothbard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, the “anarchy” of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot; by Peter Sabatini] in issue #41 (Fall/Winter 1994–95) of ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].{{-}}

Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909'', p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot; – censorship of sexual information. Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''Der arme Teufel''. In Argentina anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' ({{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;molyneux&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a &quot;double struggle&quot; for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html Mujeres Libres – Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] was a main founder of the Spanish [[anarcha-feminist]] federation [[Mujeres Libres]] who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wzar.unizar.es/siem/articulos/Premios/MujeresLibres.pdf &quot;basta pensar en el lesbianismo de Lucía Sánchez Saornil&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;&quot;R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera académica de número], Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[sección feminista de CNT]... Incluso existía un círculo sáfico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia. P. ¿Se declaraban lesbianas? R. Había quien no se escondía mucho, como Polo o Durán, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de Sánchez Saornil, sus textos no eran explícitos para poder publicarlos, así que hay que reinterpretarlos.&quot;[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/12/06/paisvasco/1196973608_850215.html &quot;Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos&quot; by Juan Fernandez at ''El Pais'']&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment.

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via [[Robert Owen|Owen]]), emphasized – as we would expect – the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values.[http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm &quot;Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren&quot; by Crispin Sartwell]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters&amp;nbsp;... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=The False Principle of our Education|author=Max Stirner |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''...&amp;nbsp;The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C.

Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html| archivedate= 7 August 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: &quot;This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868–1936''. AK Press, 1998, p. 115. ISBN 1-873176-04-X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901. Russian [[christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html &quot;The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance&quot; by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W.

Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; For him &quot;without compulsion, education was transformed into culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt;

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that &quot;A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of &quot;hearts not heads in the school&quot;. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy  ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |date=September–October 2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{Main|Criticisms of anarchism}}
Criticisms of anarchism include [[morality|moral]] criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book ''European Socialism'' argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He also argued that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
